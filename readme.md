Big thanks to **Karpfen** who gave me the idea in the first place, and who endured me while I tried to make the preview images prettier :D

## About

These files were auto-generated by **flockenberger**.

The names were provided by **Karpfen** together with old leaked data. 

Land of the Morning Light Zones do not (yet) have proper names!
Additionally, we **do not** know how exactly the fishing spots are layed out in LOML, these are just hypotheticals as of now.

These waypoints were generated by using blob detection on the original fishing bitmap 
which you can find on [BDOLytics](https://bdolytics.com/en/EU/map).

Side-note:
`All Y positions are set to 0!`
If you encounter specific problems with it lmk.
