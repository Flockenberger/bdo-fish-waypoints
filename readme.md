# Fishing Waypoints for Black Desert Online
These files were created to make your fishing life in BDO easier.

Big thanks to **Karpfen** who gave me the idea in the first place, and who endured me while I tried to make the preview images prettier :D

If you are curious how I created the waypoints, I wrote about them [HERE](https://flockenberger.github.io/blog/black-desert-online-fishing-waypoints/).

## About

These files were auto-generated by **flockenberger**.

The names were provided by **Karpfen** together with old leaked data. 

These waypoints were generated by using blob detection on the original fishing bitmap 
which you can find on [BDOLytics](https://bdolytics.com/en/EU/map).
