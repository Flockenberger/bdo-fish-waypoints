## ⚠️ Disclaimer
Waypoints are generated based on the __**character’s position**__ — __not__ where the fishing float landed.
Fish are determined by where your **float** lands!
In ocean spots especially, the direction you cast your rod can place your float in a **different fishing zone**, which may result in catching the wrong type of fish.
Please pay attention to the preview images showing where each location is in relation to the outlined zones.

- You can verify your float’s position using the guide [**HERE**](https://flockenberger.github.io/bdo-fish-position/)
- Or watch the video guide [**HERE**](https://youtu.be/t-VXcRoNojk)
