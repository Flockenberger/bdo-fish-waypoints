# Fishing Waypoints for Black Desert Online

This repository contains waypoints for **individual fish** in **Black Desert Online (BDO)**.  
Each waypoint marks a known fishing spot where a specific fish can be caught.

## üìå How it works
- Waypoints are created based on the **player‚Äôs position** in-game.  
- They are not tied to where your **fishing float** lands.  
- In most cases, standing on the marked waypoint and casting will put you in the correct fishing zone.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**  
- In rare situations, if a waypoint lies on the **edge of a fishing zone**, casting in the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù direction may place your float in a different zone.  
- This can result in catching the wrong type of fish.  

Also, some waypoints may be in the grand ocean like Magoria or in the great Black Desert, in which case they wont worko for you, unless you have a compass that allows you to place waypoints in such locations!
